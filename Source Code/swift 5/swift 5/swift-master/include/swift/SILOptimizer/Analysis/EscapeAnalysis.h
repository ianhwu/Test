/// EscapeAnalysis provides information about whether the lifetime of an object
/// exceeds the scope of a function.
///
/// We compute escape analysis by building a connection graph for each
/// function. For interprocedural analysis the connection graphs are merged
/// in bottom-up order of the call graph.
/// The idea is based on "Escape analysis for Java." by J.-D. Choi, M. Gupta, M.
/// Serrano, V. C. Sreedhar, and S. Midkiff
/// http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/320384.320386
///
/// This design is customized for SIL and the Swift memory model as follows:
///
/// Each SILValue holding a memory address or object reference is mapped to a
/// node in the connection graph. The node's type depends on the value's
/// origin. SILArguments have "argument" type. Locally allocated storage and
/// values of unknown origin have "value" type. Loaded values have "content"
/// type. A "return" type node represents the returned value and has no
/// associated SILValue.
///
/// "Content" nodes are special in that they represent the identity of some set
/// of memory locations. Content nodes are created to represent the memory
/// pointed to by one of the other node types. So, except for loads, SILValues
/// do not directly map to content nodes. For debugging purposes only, content
/// nodes do refer back to the SILValue that originally pointed to them. When
/// content nodes are merged, only one of those SILValue back-references is
/// arbitrarily preserved. The content of the returned value is the only content
/// node that has no back-reference to a SILValue.
///
/// This code:
///   let a = SomeClass()
///   return a
///
/// Generates the following connection graph, where 'a' is in the SILValue %0:
///   Val %0 Esc: R, Succ: (%0.1) // Represents 'a', and points to 'a's content
///   Con %0.1 Esc: G, Succ:      // Represents the content of 'a'
///   Ret  Esc: R, Succ: %0       // The returned value, aliased with 'a'
///
/// Each node has an escaping state: None, (R)eturn, (A)rguments, or (G)lobal.
/// These states form a lattice in which None is the most refined, or top, state
/// and Global is the least refined, or bottom, state. Merging nodes performs a
/// meet operation on their escaping states. At a call site, the callee graph is
/// merged with the callee graph by merging the respective call argument
/// nodes. A node has a "Return" escaping state if it only escapes by being
/// returned from the current function. A node has an "Argument" escaping state
/// if only escapes by being passed as an incoming argument to this function.
///
/// A directed edge between two connection graph nodes indicates that the memory
/// represented by the destination node memory is reachable via an address
/// contained in the source node. A node may only have one "pointsTo" edge,
/// whose destination is always a content node. Additional "defer" edges allow a
/// form of aliasing between nodes. A single content node represents any and all
/// memory that any other node may point to. This content node can be found by
/// following any path of defer edges until the path terminates in a pointsTo
/// edge. The final pointsTo edge refers to the representative content node, and
/// all such paths in the graph must reach the same content node. To maintain
/// this invariant, the algorithm that builds the connection graph must
/// incrementally merge content nodes.
///
/// Note that a defer edge may occur between any node types. A value node that
/// holds a reference may defer to another value or content node whose value was
/// merged via a phi; a content node that holds a reference may defer to a value
/// node that was stored into the content; a content node may defer to another
/// content node that was loaded and stored.
///
/// Now consider the same example, but declaring a 'var' instead of a 'let':
///
///   var a = SomeClass()
///   return a
///
/// Generates the following connection graph, where the alloc_stack for variable
/// 'a' is in the SILValue %0 and class allocation returns SILValue %3.
///   Val %0 Esc: G, Succ: (%0.1)
///   Con %0.1 Esc: G, Succ: %3
///   Val %3 Esc: G, Succ: (%3.1)
///   Con %3.1 Esc: G, Succ:
///   Ret  Esc: R, Succ: %3
///
/// The value node for variable 'a' now points to local variable storage
/// (%0.1). That local variable storage contains a reference. Assignment into
/// that reference creates a defer edge to the allocated reference (%3). The
/// allocated reference in turn points to the object storage (%3.1).
///
/// Note that a variable holding a single class reference and a variable
/// holding a non-trivial struct has the same graph representation. The
/// variable's content node only represents the value of the references, not the
/// memory pointed-to by the reference.
///
/// A pointsTo edge does not necessarily indicate pointer indirection. It may
/// simply represent a derived address within the same object. This allows
/// escape analysis to view an object's memory in layers, each with separate
/// escaping properties. For example, a class object's first-level content node
/// represents the object header including the metadata pointer and reference
/// count. An object's second level content node only represents the
/// reference-holding fields within that object. Consider the connection graph
/// for a class with properties:
///
///   class HasObj {
///     var obj: AnyObject
///   }
///   func assignProperty(h: HasObj, o: AnyObject) {
///     h.obj = o
///   }
///
/// Which generates this graph where the argument 'h' is %0, and 'o' is %1:
///   Arg %0 Esc: A, Succ: (%0.1)
///   Con %0.1 Esc: A, Succ: (%0.2)
///   Con %0.2 Esc: A, Succ: %1
///   Arg %1 Esc: A, Succ: (%1.1)
///   Con %1.1 Esc: A, Succ: (%1.2)
///   Con %1.2 Esc: G, Succ:
///
/// Node %0.1 represents the header of 'h', including reference count and
/// metadata pointer. This node points to %0.2 which represents the 'obj'
/// property. The assignment 'h.obj = o' creates a defer edge from %0.2 to
/// %1. Similarly, %1.1 represents the header of 'o', and %1.2 represents any
/// potential nontrivial properties in 'o' which may have escaped globally when
/// 'o' was released.
///
/// The connection graph is constructed by summarizing all memory operations in
/// a flow-insensitive way. Hint: ConGraph->viewCG() displays the Dot-formatted
/// connection graph.
///
/// In addition to the connection graph, EscapeAnalysis stores information about
/// "use points". Each release operation is a use points. These instructions are
/// recorded in a table and given an ID. Each connection graph node stores a
/// bitset indicating the use points reachable via the CFG by that node. This
/// provides some flow-sensitive information on top of the otherwise flow
/// insensitive connection graph.
///
/// Note: storing bitsets in each node may be unnecessary overhead since the
/// same information can be obtained with a graph traversal, typically of only
/// 1-3 hops.
