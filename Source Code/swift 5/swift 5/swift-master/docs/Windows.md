# Getting Started with Swift on Windows

One can build and run Swift natively or through the Windows Subsystem for Linux.

## Native Windows

Currently there are two supported ways to build Swift for Windows.

1. To cross-compile Swift for Windows from another host operating system (using `clang`), see [Cross Compiling for Windows](./WindowsCrossCompile.md)

1. To build on Windows using Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC), see [Building on Windows](./WindowsBuild.md#MSVC)

## Windows Subsystem for Linux

[Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) is an Ubuntu environment.  Follow the instructions for building on [Linux](../README.md#linux)
