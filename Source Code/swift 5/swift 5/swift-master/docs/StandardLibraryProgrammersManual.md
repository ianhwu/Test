# Standard Library Programmers Manual

This is meant to be a guide to people working on the standard library. It covers coding standards, code organization, best practices, internal annotations, and provides a guide to standard library internals. This document is inspired by LLVM's excellent [programmer's manual](http://llvm.org/docs/ProgrammersManual.html) and [coding standards](http://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html).

## Internals

#### Unwrapping Optionals

Optionals can be unwrapped with `!`, which triggers a trap on nil. Alternatively, they can be `.unsafelyUnwrapped()`, which will check and trap in debug builds of user code. Internal to the standard library is `._unsafelyUnwrappedUnchecked()` which will only check and trap in debug builds of the standard library itself. These correspond directly with `_precondition`, `_debugPrecondition`, and `_sanityCheck`. See [that section](#precondition) for details.

#### UnsafeBitCast and Casting References

In general `unsafeBitCast` should be avoided because its correctness relies on subtle assumptions that will never be enforced, and it indicates a bug in Swift's type system that should be fixed. It's less bad for non-pointer trivial types. Pointer casting should go through one of the memory binding API instead as a last resort.

Reference casting is more interesting. References casting can include converting to an Optional reference and converting from a class constrained existential.

The regular `as` operator should be able to convert between reference types with full dynamic checking.

`unsafeDownCast` is just as capable, but is only dynamically checked in debug mode or if the cast requires runtime support.

`_unsafeUncheckedDowncast` is the same but is only dynamically checked in the stdlib asserts build, or if the cast requires runtime support.

`_unsafeReferenceCast` is only dynamically checked if the cast requires runtime support. Additionally, it does not impose any static `AnyObject` constraint on the incoming reference. This is useful in a generic context where the object-ness can be determined dynamically, as done in some bridged containers.

### Builtins

#### `_fastPath` and `_slowPath`

`_fastPath` returns its argument, wrapped in a Builtin.expect. This informs the optimizer that the vast majority of the time, the branch will be taken (i.e. the then branch is “hot”). The SIL optimizer may alter heuristics for anything dominated by the then branch. But the real performance impact comes from the fact that the SIL optimizer will consider anything dominated by the else branch to be infrequently executed (i.e. “cold”). This means that transformations that may increase code size have very conservative heuristics to keep the rarely executed code small.

The probabilities are passed through to LLVM as branch weight metadata, to leverage LLVM’s use of GCC style builtin_expect knowledge (e.g. for code layout and low-level inlining).

`_fastPath` probabilities are compounding, see the example below. For this reason, it can actually degrade performance in non-intuitive ways as it marks all other code (including subsequent `_fastPath`s) as being cold. Consider `_fastPath` as basically spraying the rest of the code with a Mr. Freeze-style ice gun.

`_slowPath` is the same as `_fastPath`, just with the branches swapped.

*Example:*

```swift
if _fastPath(...) {
  // 90% of the time we execute this: aggressive inlining
  ...
  return
}
// 10% of the time we execute this: very conservative inlining
...
if _fastPath(...) {
  // 9% of the time we execute this: very conservative inlining
    ...
    return
}

// 1% of the time we execute this: very conservative inlining
...
return
```


#### `_onFastPath`

This should be rarely used. It informs the SIL optimizer that any code dominated by it should be treated as the innermost loop of a performance critical section of code. It cranks optimizer heuristics to 11. Injudicious use of this will degrade performance and bloat binary size.


#### <a name="precondition"></a>`_precondition`, `_debugPrecondition`, and `_internalInvariant`

These three functions are assertions that will trigger a run time trap if violated.

* `_precondition` executes in all build configurations. Use this for invariant enforcement in all user code build configurations
* `_debugPrecondition` will execute when **user code** is built with assertions enabled. Use this for invariant enforcement that's useful while debugging, but might be prohibitively expensive when user code is configured without assertions.
* `_internalInvariant` will execute when **standard library code** is built with assertions enabled. Use this for internal only invariant checks that useful for debugging the standard library itself.

#### `_fixLifetime`

A call to `_fixLifetime` is considered a use of its argument, meaning that the argument is guaranteed to live at least up until the call. It is otherwise a nop. This is useful for guaranteeing the lifetime of a value while inspecting its physical layout. Without a call to `_fixLifetime`, the last formal use may occur while the value's bits are still being munged.

*Example:*

```swift
var x = ...
defer { _fixLifetime(x) } // Guarantee at least lexical lifetime for x
let theBits = unsafeBitCast(&x, ...)
... // use of theBits in ways that may outlive x if it weren't for the _fixLifetime call
```

### Annotations

#### `@_transparent`

Should only be used if necessary. This has the effect of forcing inlining to occur before any dataflow analyses take place. Unless you specifically need this behavior, use `@_inline(__always)` or some other mechanism. Its primary purpose is to force the compiler's static checks to peer into the body for diagnostic purposes.

Use of this attribute imposes limitations on what can be in the body. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/TransparentAttr.rst).

#### `@unsafe_no_objc_tagged_pointer`

This is currently used in the standard library as an additional annotation applied to @objc protocols signifying that any objects which conform to this protocol are not tagged. This means that (on Darwin platforms) such references, unlike AnyObject, have spare bits available from things like restricted memory spaces or alignment.

#### `@_silgen_name`

This attribute specifies the name that a declaration will have at link time. It is used for two purposes, the second of which is currently considered bad practice and should be replaced with shims:

1. To specify the symbol name of a Swift function so that it can be called from Swift-aware C. Such functions have bodies.
2. To provide a Swift declaration which really represents a C declaration. Such functions do not have bodies.

##### Using `@_silgen_name` to call Swift from Swift-aware C

Rather than hard-code Swift mangling into C code, `@_silgen_name` is used to provide a stable and known symbol name for linking. Note that C code still must understand and use the Swift calling convention (available in swift-clang) for such Swift functions (if they use Swift's CC). Example:

```swift
@_silgen_name("_destroyTLS")
internal func _destroyTLS(_ ptr: UnsafeMutableRawPointer?) {
  // ... implementation ...
}
```

```C++
SWIFT_CC(swift) SWIFT_RUNTIME_STDLIB_INTERNAL
void _destroyTLS(void *);

// ... C code can now call _destroyTLS on a void * ...
```

##### Using `@_silgen_name` to call C from Swift

The standard library cannot import the Darwin module (much less an ICU module), yet it needs access to these C functions that it otherwise wouldn't have a decl for. For that, we use shims. But, `@_silgen_name` can also be used on a body-less Swift function declaration to denote that it's an external C function whose symbol will be available at link time, even if not available at compile time. This usage is discouraged.


### Internal structures

#### `_FixedArray`

The standard library has internal fixed size arrays of some limited sizes. This provides fast random access into contiguous (usually stack-allocated) memory. These are metaprogrammed based on size, so if you need a new size not currently defined, add it to the `sizes` gyb variable. See [FixedArray.swift.gyb](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/stdlib/public/core/FixedArray.swift.gyb) for implementation.

#### Thread Local Storage

The standard library utilizes thread local storage (TLS) to cache expensive computations or operations in a thread-safe fashion. This is currently used for tracking some ICU state for Strings. Adding new things to this struct is a little more involved, as Swift lacks some of the features required for it to be expressed elegantly (e.g. move-only structs):

1. Add the new member to `_ThreadLocalStorage` and a static `getMyNewMember` method to access it. `getMyNewMember` should be implemented using `getPointer`.
2. If the member is not trivially initializable, update `_initializeThreadLocalStorage` and `_ThreadLocalStorage.init`.
3. If the field is not trivially destructable, update `_destroyTLS` to properly destroy the value.

See [ThreadLocalStorage.swift](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/stdlib/public/core/ThreadLocalStorage.swift) for more details.


## Working with Resilience

Maintaining ABI compatibility with previously released versions of the standard library makes things more complicated. This section details some of the extra rules to remember and patterns to use.

### The Curiously Recursive Inlinable Switch Pattern (CRISP)

When inlinable code switches over a non-frozen enum, it has to handle possible future cases (since it will be inlined into a module outside the standard library). You can see this in action with the implementation of `round(_:)` in FloatingPointTypes.swift.gyb, which takes a FloatingPointRoundingRule. It looks something like this:

```swift
@_transparent
public mutating func round(_ rule: FloatingPointRoundingRule) {
  switch rule {
  case .toNearestOrAwayFromZero:
    _value = Builtin.int_round_FPIEEE${bits}(_value)
  case .toNearestOrEven:
    _value = Builtin.int_rint_FPIEEE${bits}(_value)
  // ...
  @unknown default:
    self._roundSlowPath(rule)
  }
}
```

Making `round(_:)` inlinable but still have a default case is an attempt to get the best of both worlds: if the rounding rule is known at compile time, the call will compile down to a single instruction in optimized builds; and if it dynamically turns out to be a new kind of rounding rule added in Swift 25 (e.g. `.towardFortyTwo`), there's a fallback function, `_roundSlowPath(_:)`, that can handle it.

So what does `_roundSlowPath(_:)` look like? Well, it can't be inlinable, because that would defeat the purpose. It *could* just look like this:

```swift
@usableFromInline
internal mutating func _roundSlowPath(_ rule: FloatingPointRoundingRule) {
  switch rule {
  case .toNearestOrAwayFromZero:
    _value = Builtin.int_round_FPIEEE${bits}(_value)
  case .toNearestOrEven:
    _value = Builtin.int_rint_FPIEEE${bits}(_value)
  // ...
  }
}
```

...i.e. exactly the same as `round(_:)` but with no `default` case. That's guaranteed to be up to date if any new cases are added in the future. But it seems a little silly, since it's duplicating code that's in `round(_:)`. We *could* omit cases that have always existed, but there's a better answer:

```swift
// Slow path for new cases that might have been inlined into an old
// ABI-stable version of round(_:) called from a newer version. If this is
// the case, this non-inlinable function will call into the _newer_ version
// which _will_ support this rounding rule.
@usableFromInline
internal mutating func _roundSlowPath(_ rule: FloatingPointRoundingRule) {
  self.round(rule)
}
```

Because `_roundSlowPath(_:)` isn't inlinable, the version of `round(_:)` that gets called at run time will always be the version implemented in the standard library dylib. And since FloatingPointRoundingRule is *also* defined in the standard library, we know it'll never be out of sync with this version of `round(_:)`.

Maybe some day we'll have special syntax in the language to say "call this method without allowing inlining" to get the same effect, but for now, this Curiously Recursive Inlinable Switch Pattern allows for safe inlining of switches over non-frozen enums with less boilerplate than you might otherwise have. Not none, but less.
